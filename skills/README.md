# Shared Skills Directory

Store reusable skills for multiple tools in this directory.

Recommended structure:

- One folder per skill, for example: `skills/release-check/SKILL.md`
- Describe triggers, workflow, and verification steps in each `SKILL.md`
- Keep related scripts or templates inside the same skill folder
